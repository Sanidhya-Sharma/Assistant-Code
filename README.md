**This idea came up my mind when i had to the same redundant task everytime i had to open my Personal computer why don't I have someone
softwere to do the same! I know there are softweres but they have a payment for it! duh! and so i thought why not python could help me 
so i started building this voice assistant and here i am :smile:** <br>

~~Doing the same task again and again~~ <br>
